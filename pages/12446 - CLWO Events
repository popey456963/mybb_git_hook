I have a spare server at the moment, and I feel like we should do some more community things for CLWO that are more light-hearted than the competitive games. Thus, I introduce, CLWO Events. (Original name, right?)

So, I'm looking for other staff members who would be willing to help run a short 1-2 hour custom event occasionally on a Sunday evening that is meant for just light humour (such as a deathrun game, or a one in the chamber gamemode, or really anything :)). It seems to be best if you run an event with one techy, one literary person and one presenter, so name which one of these you'd like to do most as well as your name if you would like to participate.

Currently Signed Up:
- JJ.Watt (Presenter Preference)
- Spent Brass (Literary Preference)

Taua and Spent Brass appear to be doing the first one of these, a minigames event!

(Test addition from GH)
